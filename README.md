# Python_calculator-Project
## Calculator Project Description
Objective: Create a Python program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers.

Features:

User-friendly interface to input two numbers and select an operation.
Perform the selected operation and display the result.
Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric inputs).

## Explanation:

Functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide are defined to perform their respective operations.
Menu Display: The calculator function displays a menu for the user to choose an operation and input two numbers.
Input Handling: The program prompts the user to enter numeric values for the numbers and checks for valid operations.
Error Handling: Division by zero is handled by checking if the divisor is zero before performing the division.

## Usage:

Run the script.
Enter your choice of operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
Enter two numbers when prompted.
The result of the operation will be displayed.
This basic calculator example demonstrates fundamental concepts in Python programming such as functions, user input handling, and conditional statements. Depending on your needs, you can extend this project with additional features like handling more complex operations, implementing a GUI using libraries like Tkinter, or adding error checking for input validation.
